# Map Feature Improvements for NGDI Metadata Portal

## Overview
The NGDI Metadata Portal currently has a basic map feature implemented using MapLibre GL JS and Leaflet. Based on a code review, several areas for improvement have been identified to enhance the functionality, reliability, and user experience of the map feature.

## Current Implementation
- Main map page at `/map` using MapLibre GL JS
- Map demo at `/todo/map-demo` showing Nigerian cities
- Basic layer control for switching between map styles (streets, satellite, terrain)
- Integration with metadata records to display geographic bounds
- MapTiler API key required for satellite and terrain styles

## Improvement Areas

### 1. Error Handling
The current implementation lacks robust error handling for cases where the MapTiler API key is missing or invalid. This can lead to a poor user experience when map styles fail to load.

**Requirements:**
- Implement proper error handling for missing or invalid MapTiler API key
- Add fallback mechanisms for when map styles fail to load
- Provide user-friendly error messages when map components cannot be rendered
- Add logging for map-related errors to aid in debugging

### 2. Performance Optimization
The map libraries (MapLibre GL JS and Leaflet) are relatively large and can impact initial load time. Performance optimizations are needed to improve the user experience.

**Requirements:**
- Optimize the loading of map libraries to reduce initial page load time
- Implement progressive loading of map features
- Optimize marker rendering for large datasets
- Implement caching strategies for map tiles and styles
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders of map components

### 3. Feature Enhancements
The current map functionality is basic and could be expanded to include more interactive features and better integration with the metadata management aspects of the portal.

**Requirements:**
- Add location search functionality to the map
- Implement drawing tools for creating custom areas/polygons
- Enhance integration with metadata visualization
- Add the ability to filter and display metadata records on the map
- Implement clustering for markers when displaying multiple points
- Add measurement tools for distances and areas
- Support for exporting map views as images or sharing links

## Success Criteria
- All map components should gracefully handle error conditions
- Map page should load within 3 seconds on standard connections
- Users should be able to search for locations and navigate the map easily
- Drawing and measurement tools should be intuitive and accurate
- Metadata records should be properly visualized on the map when applicable

## Technical Constraints
- Continue using MapLibre GL JS as the primary mapping library
- Maintain compatibility with the existing MapTiler integration
- Ensure all new features work on both desktop and mobile devices
- Follow the existing project structure and coding standards
