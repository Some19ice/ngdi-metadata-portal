# NGDI Metadata Portal - Executive Presentation

## 🎯 What We're Building

**A National Digital Library for Nigeria's Maps and Location Data**

Think of this as **"Google Maps meets a National Library"**—but specifically for Nigeria's geospatial (map and location) information. It's a central hub where government agencies, researchers, and businesses can find, share, and use Nigeria's valuable location-based data.

## 🏞️ The Problem We're Solving

**Current Situation:**

- Nigeria's map and location data is scattered across 100+ government agencies
- Each agency keeps their data in different formats and locations
- Finding the right data takes weeks or months
- Duplicate data collection wastes resources
- Critical decisions are made without complete information

**Real Examples:**

- Ministry of Works planning roads without knowing about protected areas
- Emergency responders can't quickly access flood risk data
- Researchers can't find population data for their studies
- Private companies duplicate expensive surveys

## 🛠️ Our Solution

**One Central Platform for All Nigeria's Location Data**

**What It Does:**

- **Search & Discover:** Find any map or location data in Nigeria instantly
- **Share & Collaborate:** Government agencies can share data securely
- **Visualize:** See data on interactive maps
- **Manage:** Keep track of data quality and updates
- **Access:** Control who can see what data
